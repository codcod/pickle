## [Unreleased]

Initial feature set. A single Go binary that installs and operates a
ticket-based, board-driven feature flow in any project, developed by
self-hosting that very flow (see `tickets/`).

### Added

- **Setup commands.**
  - `pickle install` scaffolds `tickets/` (status directories, `BOARD.md`,
    `NOTES.md`), installs the embedded ticket-flow skill into
    `.agents/skills/ticket-flow/`, wires it up for detected coding agents
    (Claude Code, opencode, Pi) via `--agent`-selectable symlinks and configs,
    injects marker blocks into `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, writes `pickle.toml`,
    and registers the first child-project.
  - `pickle upgrade` refreshes the installed skill payload and marker block to
    the binary's version — never touching tickets or hand-written content.
  - `pickle uninstall [--dry-run]` removes the skill, symlinks and markers,
    leaving `tickets/` and `pickle.toml` intact.
  - `pickle doctor` verifies install integrity: skill payload, agent symlinks,
    marker blocks, and child-project paths.
  - `pickle project add|list|remove` manages the registry of connected
    child-projects (removal is refused while a child has live tickets).
- **Flow commands.**
  - `pickle ticket new` allocates the next `T-NNN` id, scaffolds the ticket
    from the template, and regenerates the board. `--spawned-by` records
    review-finding lineage without ever gating pickup.
  - `pickle ticket move` transitions a ticket atomically: file move, dated
    `## History` line, and board regeneration — enforcing the status state
    machine, per-child WIP limits, and the dependency gate.
  - `pickle board audit` checks the ticket invariants and board freshness,
    exiting non-zero on any error.
  - `pickle board sync` regenerates `BOARD.md` wholesale from ticket
    frontmatter and file locations — the board is a generated artifact, never
    hand-edited.
- **Embedded ticket-flow skill** (`skill/`, shipped inside the binary): the
  flow rules, ticket template, and review protocol that teach a coding agent
  to author, refine, implement and review tickets. Review findings are
  classified by severity and dispositioned (note-and-close by default) instead
  of spawning tickets unboundedly.
- **docs-readability reviewer**: an optional, suggestions-only Gemini subagent
  for AsciiDoc/Markdown prose during ticket review, scaffolded for both
  opencode and Pi from a single shared prompt.
- **Distribution**: goreleaser config and a tag-driven GitHub release workflow
  producing `darwin`/`linux` × `amd64`/`arm64` archives with checksums, plus a
  Homebrew formula published to `codcod/homebrew-tap`
  (`brew install codcod/tap/pickle`). `go install github.com/codcod/pickle`
  works too, with the version read from build info.
- **Documentation**: an AsciiDoc user manual (`docs/user-manual.adoc`) in
  three parts — Start Here, Concepts, CLI Reference — validated with
  `just docs-check` and rendered to PDF/EPUB with `just docs-build` (both via
  [snowball](https://github.com/codcod/snowball)).
